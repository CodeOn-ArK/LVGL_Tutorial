# LVGL_Tutorial

## How to use :

- run `idf.py menuconfig` to set the display specific properties like drivers, pin assignment and several other properties
- to test your implementation run the template application

## LVGL specific :

- Detatiled documentation is found ![here](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/intro/index.html#)
- In LVGL every component on screen is treated as an object. We can change the colour of the object, size, shape, properties etc, by using corresponding lvgl APIs
- Text can have several different fonts/colour along with options to make the font bold/italic
- Widgets can be animated, or any particular icon can be animated
